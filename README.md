- re-estimating E0s via least squares
- analysis of model performance: loss, RMSEs, observables from MD

### CSD3 and FAST-pc scripts
- example slurm script used to run bash and python scripts
- example bash scripts for model training and fine-tuning
- example python script for running MD on the CaCO$_3$/H$_2$O system
